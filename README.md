# chess-engine
You can run the game engine simply by running '''python chessmain.py''' if you're on windows, or run ''' python3 chessmain.py  ''' 
The game files are split into the main file and the game engine, intuitively the main is where the logic gets executed and the engine is where the logic is created
for the game I used pygame and a sampled image file which contains certain notation for easy data structure handling, if you have improvements or a better way feel free to contribute.
